<p>Just a few weeks ago, we released our internal plugin for [Lighthouse website audits] as our first open source plugin, so the whole community could use it. Today, we’re excited to add a new plugin to that list — say hello to the [Tech Radar plugin]!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We wanted to make getting started with Backstage as easy as possible. Even though Backstage is still in the early phases of its development, we believe it is important for our users to get a feel for what Backstage really is.</p>
<p>We want users to be able to create their own version of Backstage quickly and easily, so that they can take advantage of all the infrastructure that we’ve built into it — and start exploring.</p>
<p>In this blog post we’ll look at what a Backstage app is and how to create one using our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/cli">CLI</a>.</p>

<p>We’re proud to announce that our first internal plugin at Spotify has been open-sourced as part of Backstage. This plugin works with the newly open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/spotify/lighthouse-audit-service">lighthouse-audit-service</a> to run and track Lighthouse audits for your websites.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/blog/assets/2/spotify-labs-header.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Two days ago, we released the open source version of <a href="https://backstage.io/">Backstage</a>, our homegrown developer portal. And we learned a thing or two via the feedback we received. So, I wanted to take this opportunity to further explain what we’re trying to do with Backstage — and more importantly, what we want to give to the greater engineering community beyond Spotify.</p>

<p>Backstage is Spotify's open source platform for building developer portals.</p>
<p>It’s the first open source infrastructure platform by Spotify that allows you to focus on building your application instead of reinventing the button.  With an elegant and unified, yet opinionated UI/UX for all your tooling and infrastructure, Backstage enables engineers to get up and running faster, which ultimately makes their lives easier and more productive.</p>
